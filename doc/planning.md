# CMPUT 301 Planning

This document contains the outline of how I want the interactions to work on this android app for expense tracking.

## Goal of the program

- Track subscriptions
  - Add new expense
  - Edit previous expense
  - Delete expense
- Display the expenses

The data that is stored also have to be in a certain format, so we should be doing a check on the correctness of the user input.

## TODO

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Make the main activity | For now, try to make the list view for the application |

## Research

### Can you make a database on android studio

Local data is sufficient for our use, I believe.

#### Options

- sqlite
  - Might be a little overkill
- internal storage
- external storage
  - Not going to be available.

Should research internal storage solution then
